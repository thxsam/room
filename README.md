- **Quick Booking**: Directly book an available room matching your default configuration
- **Book a Room by Name**: Directly book an available room by specifying its name.
- **Configuration File Support**: Customize default settings such as booking duration, preferred floor, and minimum capacity through a configuration file.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://repository-url.git
   cd room
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then set up a virtual environment and install the required packages.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Google Calendar API**: Follow the [Google Calendar API Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python) to set up your credentials. Save the credentials file as `credentials.json` in `~/.room/credentials.json`

   ```

## Usage

- **List Available Rooms**: Run the utility with the `-l` flag to list all available rooms.

  ```bash
  python main.py -l
  ```
- **Book a Room**: Specify the name of the room you wish to book using the `-n` option.

  ```bash
  Â²python main.py -n "Room Name"
  ```
- **Specify Duration, Floor, and Capacity**: Use the `-d`, `-f`, and `-c` options to set the duration (in minutes), floor, and minimum capacity, respectively.

  ```bash
  python main.py -d 60 -f 2 -c 4
  ```

## Customization
